# Astro260Homework
Here is my first homework for Astro 260. My graph is really basic. It looks ok when using 100 values, but gets way too crowded when using 1000 or 10000. 

The main body of homework 2 is in Homework2.py. When you run the program, it will print out the answers to part a through d, and also pop up the graph automatically. You can go into the file and change the values of A and Z for the earlier calculations. The variables are marked with comments to make them easy to find. The second page of the homework is in int_error.py and float_error.py. You should just be able to run these programs and they will print out the requested statements from the homework.
